# Pandas_Challenge

What did I do in this project?
I used the Pandas library in a jupyter notebook to obtain, clean, transform, analyze, visualize, and extract data-driven insights for a mock school district. 

Data Insights:
1. The overall passing rate (passing rate of math and reading combined) was over 20% higher at Charter Schools (95.10%) compared to that at District Schools (73.67%). 
2. Medium and Small schools had relatively similar overall passing rates (95.20% & 94.82% respectively) which differed from the overall passing rate at Large Schools (76.36%). 
3. Schools who spent less money per student (<$585 per student) had a higher overall passing rate (95.04%) then schools who spent more money per student (budget: $645-$675 per student, overall passing rate: 73.65%).
4. More students passed reading across the district (85.81%) compared to math (74.98%).
